Scouting13
==========
ATA's Java swing application used for scouting at competitions.

This was a high school project for [Team 4334](http://www.4334.ca/) in 2013.

It's use is to track the performance of other teams and make predictions for
matches / rankings / pick lists. It used a semi-distributed data system that
we transfered over USB sticks because of the lack of internet access at events.
